My 1070 made a pop and was smoking after like 5 or 6 years, really bummed me out, so I got the RTX3060 as the pricing was the sweet spot for me, I thought that since it was so much newer, and the name has a much higher number (3060 vs 1070), and its Nvidia, that the performance would be quite phenomenal compared to what I had. Nope. (that's why 4 stars instead of 5) Meager difference with my (Asus Rampage 4 Extreme 2011 socket mobo, 32 gig ripjaw ram, intel i7-3820 cpu, 64X). Again, it IS a good video card but I should have went for the 4000 series for more cash.....probably.",[],

"Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet productivity bundle with Keyboard Case, Stylus Pen, octa-core processor, 4 GB RAM to do more throughout your day, 128 GB, Gray, without lockscreen ads",Surprisingly good tablet for productivity from Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stoneweaver28,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2024","Purchased this tablet as an upgrade for my wife, who has the 10.Pros:*The HD screen is amazing and vibrant. It shows off media very well and is bright even when outside. It's also nice and big as well.*The speakers are fine (they won't be winning awards, but it's a tablet and does the job)*The processor is snappy, my wife hasn't run into any lag issues. It's fast and responsive.*MS Office (being able to use office suite is what sets this apart.) Works great with the keyboard you can buy.*If you buy the pen, it adds another layer of productivity to it.*The overall slim design. It doesn't feel cheap, or like a toy like older models which had those plastic backs.CONSKeyboard not included-I understand that no tablet really comes with one, but I feel it should. When you add the keyboard to this tablet, you really have the option of being very productive and utilizing MS office to its max.no pen included-seems like something that should be included, they aren't that expensive to add.Amazon App store-Why amazon still refuses to allow the google play store is beyond me. You are still locked into the Amazon app store. While most people won't have a problem with it (most of your content consumption apps are available) you will find yourself running into a few apps that you use on your google phones, that you won't be able to have on your tablet.Overall, nothing that I criticized about the tablet are deal breakers. Amazon runs specials that bundle keyboards and pens with the tablet all the time. Overall, this seems like the table that most people should buy, it's light, responsive and best of all, waaay cheaper than an ipad, and does most, but not all that an ipad can do.",[],
"Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet productivity bundle with Keyboard Case, Stylus Pen, octa-core processor, 4 GB RAM to do more throughout your day, 128 GB, Gray, without lockscreen ads",A very efficient and low cost tablet.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fidelity Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2024","Having used the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet for the past six months, I can confidently say that it offers a solid performance for its price range. The 11-inch display is a standout feature, boasting a crisp 2000 x 1200 resolution. This provides clear and vibrant visuals, making it a pleasure to watch movies, browse photos, or read e-books. The screen's brightness and color accuracy are impressive, even in direct sunlight, which is ideal for outdoor use. The overall build quality of the tablet is robust, with a sleek aluminum body that feels premium and durable in hand, making it both aesthetically pleasing and sturdy for daily use.In terms of performance, the Fire Max 11 is powered by an octa-core processor and 4GB of RAM, which delivers smooth and responsive app performance. Navigating through the interface is generally fluid, and most apps load quickly without significant lag. This makes it suitable for a variety of tasks, from streaming HD video content to playing casual games. The battery life is another strong point, offering up to 12 hours of mixed-use on a single charge, ensuring that the tablet can easily last through a day of moderate to heavy use without needing a recharge.However, there are some limitations to consider. While the tablet handles most apps well, it struggles with more demanding applications and high-end games. There can be occasional slowdowns or stuttering when multitasking with several resource-intensive apps open at the same time. Additionally, the Amazon Fire OS, while user-friendly, is heavily integrated with Amazon services, which can feel restrictive for users who prefer a more traditional Android experience or access to the Google Play Store. Some popular apps may not be available, or may require sideloading, which could be a hassle for less tech-savvy users.Another area where the Fire Max 11 falls short is in its camera quality. The front and rear cameras are adequate for basic video calls and casual snapshots but do not deliver the high-quality images or video that more premium tablets offer. The lack of a fingerprint sensor or facial recognition for unlocking the device also feels like a missed opportunity, as these features have become standard in many modern tablets. This means relying on traditional PIN or password methods, which might be less convenient for some users. Additionally, while the tablet's build is generally solid, it is slightly heavier than some competitors, which could be a drawback for prolonged one-handed use.In conclusion, the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet offers good value with its excellent display, solid build quality, and decent performance for everyday tasks. However, its limitations in handling more demanding applications, restricted app ecosystem, and mediocre camera quality might be points of consideration for potential buyers.",[],
"Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet productivity bundle with Keyboard Case, Stylus Pen, octa-core processor, 4 GB RAM to do more throughout your day, 128 GB, Gray, without lockscreen ads","Finally, something with performance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Sportutegirl,"Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2023","***Notice: on March 6th, 2024 I have updated this review. I would append the original version, but combined with this would be too much text. If you wish to view the original version, I would suggest using the way-back machine found on the internet archive.***Preface:I have been using this tablet on-and-off for about 9 months as of the time of writing. I actually went and bought the (2023) Pixel Tablet, and installed LineageOS on it for a clean android experience, and even though not always mentioned, it is the basis of comparison for a lot of my complaints. Above all else however, it is important to note the price disparity, $230 for the Fire 11, versus $500 for the Pixel Tablet - To some less privileged, that might be enough to make it affordable whilst keeping food on the table.Chassis:Unlike any other Amazon tablet to date, this device is supported by an aluminum body, with only a single plastic insert near the top, where the speaker holes are. My only qualm is the camera bump - the rear facing camera has a bump, despite having the same resolution (8 megapixels) as the selfy camera which is flush under the screen's glass.Display and Sound:It's display is adequate, it's efficient and gets bright enough to do any task in nearly any lighting condition. The resolution however brings mixed feelings; I can notice slight aliasing (where smooth curves and angled lines can look like stairs, with distinct steps/layers) of icons on the homescreen, but not when reading books or viewing content. Since most content is produced in either 4k or 1080, increasing the resolution any higher would make the device more expensive and produce weird aliasing until you scaled the screen to 4k. Even the pixel tablet doesn't reach 4k, with a 2560x1600 screen and providing a smoother homescreen but aliasing for content if you look closely at it.Sound quality is surprisingly good. This isn't something that will rival a dedicated speaker, like an Echo or something from Bose, but I've enjoyed many a night laying in bed, watching YouTube and other content on it, without any concerns for the sound quality.Software:FireOS 8, based on android 11. It seemed palatable at launch, and it's going to be less so as the device ages, considering android 14 launched later in 2023. I'd be more mad about the version, except that there's been no interesting or really major changes in android since android 11, which has the side effect of allowing various apps an easier time maintaining compatibility.I would highly recommend anyone who's interested look up the Android Police's articles on installing the Google Play Store, it will make your experience a lot nicer (although I do note that sometimes the Google Play Store does not like it when you install SD cards, you may wish to get the 128GB model).Make no mistake however, I am thoroughly irritated at Amazon's update policy; They promise software updates and support for 4 years after the device is last available for purchase, which is industry-leading. This however does not include major OS version updates: My Fire HD 10 (2021), is still running FireOS 7, based on android 9, much to my annoyance. For a device this expensive, Amazon should be able to provide the same software support other vendors do, and update it to FireOS 9 whenever that comes out.The UI is simplistic, with a homescreen that an apple user would find familiar, but with the android controls that any lifelong android user would be able to navigate with ease. I wish Amazon would port gesture navigation, to bring the device up to parity with any Android and Apple phone released in the past 5 years, but I'm instead given 3-button navigation, which sometimes leads me to accidentally swipe backwards ineffectively.I did once complain that the Google Play Games login did not work on the device, but Amazon actually seems to have resolved that in an update released shortly after launch. I can now play Homeworld mobile, and have my progress saved across multiple devices.Performance:The processor is fast enough to not only navigate the UI, browse the web using Chrome, but even emulate some DS games (with Drastic), and play some dedicated android games. I still maintain that a device with 4GB of ram shouldn't be expected to run modern Android apps, but that's the price issue.Of slightly more annoyance, is the WiFi adapter: I've tested it and found it tops out at around 50-100 megabits per second, which is enough to stream content (1080p content is less than 5), which is weird since I have devices that adhere to the same WiFi 5 standard, that are able to download much faster. I can only presume that internally the WiFi adapter is either budget, or is connected to the processor via some really slow bus internally, like serial or something.Accessories:Amazon offers a stylus and keyboard folio. The stylus is rather interesting as Amazon includes handwriting to text conversion on the device, allowing you to write in any text box you want. I've used it a few times to take notes quickly before sending them to someone via Discord. It uses the rather rare AAAA battery, which is annoying to source replacements for, but I'd rather replace the battery than be stuck with an internal one like Apple does, since Apple's stylus will become a paperweight once the battery dies.The keyboard however is the star of the show - I love how it's folio is 2-piece, allowing me to remove the keyboard and toss it wherever if I don't need it, yet retain the (very stable) kickstand of it's backing piece. The feel of the keys themselves are meh, and I'm annoyed by the function key where the CRTL key should be, but it's not enough of a problem. It finds frequent use, allowing me to write messages on Discord, or handle other tasks without needing to bring my bulky laptop with me. The trackpad however, is useless - Android doesn't need it, and it feels a bit weird and rough.Features:This is the first tablet Amazon has released with a fingerprint sensor, and I'm honestly surprised by how reliable it is. Amazon's on-device messaging with the fingerprint sensor is also helpful (for example, it will inform you that it's been more than 72 hours since the PIN was last used, and for security reasons, forbid further fingerprint unlocks until you unlock it with the PIN at least once). It's extremely fast and seamless, immediately dropping me to the homescreen with a gentle tap of the sensor - I don't have to actually click the power button down.Desires:I understand wireless charging is an impossibility with the aluminum chassis, but I really wish Amazon released a charging/speaker dock for this thing. There's already pogo pins on the bottom for the keyboard, it wouldn't be hard to repurpose them for a dock, and it would encourage users to use it in the ""show mode"" that Amazon advertises this thing is capable of.I'd also really want major version updates. When FireOS 9 comes out, I want that on this device, not to be stuck on android 11 forever. This is Amazon's flagship, and it's powerful enough to handle it.Above all else however, I want Amazon to let me unlock the bootloader. I understand these devices are likely sold at a loss, so maybe let me buy an un-refundable unlock code for my device to make up the difference for Amazon, but let me do it.Conclusion:There's a lot of gaps where this device falls short, but it's basically unbeatable at this price range. If $500 seems insurmountable for your situation, or you want a disposable device to give a family member or child, you can't go wrong with this. My complaints whilst numerous, are not enough to drop it's rating from 5 stars in my eyes - it's still found a happy home with me.",['image_6.jpg'],video_2.mp4
"Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet productivity bundle with Keyboard Case, Stylus Pen, octa-core processor, 4 GB RAM to do more throughout your day, 128 GB, Gray, without lockscreen ads",Surprisingly decent to read on! But your needs may be different....,4.0 out of 5 stars,Quaketoys,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023","I'm somewhere between 3.5-4 stars.....I am (and fortunately my 12 yo kiddo is) an avid reader. Always have been. I write too, so my main hobby my entire life is reading. Sure, I do love other things, but you will most likely find me if I am awake and not doing anything else? Reading. My reading appetite is voracious as you can imagine and that leads me here. I'm also big into a lot of tech. I was an early adopter of e-readers and ebooks which I scoured irc, libraries, and other places to find ebooks back in ye olden pirate days. Argh. BUT today, things are so much easier. No sailing is required. I even read ahead on series I love and buy the original language ebooks and then translate them into English because today it is so simple to do! And while I read from a great many sources and websites, my kiddo and I read a ton of manga, manhua, and light novels so we hit up Amazon often. Besides getting to directly support the original author (& better publishers), we have a ton of fun swapping novels and reviewing them together. I do own the latest Kindles because one of the Kindle downsides is that you cannot buy content from an iPad or iPhone. Which bites to be honest. I often when traveling if I forgot or didn't want to lug a Kindle have to buy from Google Books or other sites because this is such a pain. I do try to keep up with new releases, but often, the next big book in one of our current 257th favorite series drops and we NEED IT NOW.I own a new huge honking iPad as my main device, and up until now, it has been my favorite to read on. (I have a bit of TED so my eyesight can vary from day to day. Some days I needed extreme readers and the next day just 1.25 is perfect. There's no rhyme or reason but I'm almost through with this the doctors say.) I do love that I can access all my favorite reading sites and spaces via iPad (except for buying Kindle books but I can read Kindle content fine). I can also keep up on my iPad with my favorite Korean and Japanese sites as they update and instantly translate our favorites. (Tech makes reading life good!) If I'm writing, I also use the iPad with a Bluetooth keyboard. My kiddo mainly reads on her iPad mini, but she has her own Kindle too.So what I'm saying is I was not going to buy this. I was like meh, looks nice but, I don't really NEED it. And then my bday came around Black Friday and this made it into my hot little hands. Oh, hello. I thought it was a nice gift but I would probably not keep it because it's really strangely long compared to the iPad. And skinny.BUT let me tell you where it does super well. It is a pleasure to read on. The battery life on this is incredible. I've been sick with walking pneumonia (yay), and have been reading for hours and hours and I'm still at 79% after reading the better part of 12 hours (in between coughing and catnaps here and there)! The battery life is insane. And it just looks lovely, my eyes feel super relaxed without too much adjustment. Manga is very nice on it and nothing looks warped or stretched out. I was worried where I didn't need to be.Now for some books, and I emphasize some, the text/font they chose can be too small for me. If you need big letters some days (or all days) this is not for you. You'll strain. The iPad is much more customizable and utilitarian. No question there. BUT occasionally if I am doing something else and reading on this? If I ask, Alexa will instantly pick up where I left off and read to me. I can get my iPad to do this I suppose, but this level of integration is super nice.I mean you could (or years ago I would have) jailbroke this puppy and made it exactly what it should have been. A real ereader that happened to be capable of other things. The dream of 2005! But now really? Way too much effort and money to get it to basically be like an off-brand iPad-like device from 2005. For most people, this either works because they enjoy reading what they have on it, or they will stick with their iPads.Kiddo and I do a bit of gaming and for that? OML! No. Do not do this. Save yourself! It is super slow. The lag is insane. And it randomly zooms in when it shouldn't and refuses to zoom out. We played Animal Jam just to try it out and it's soooo slow! Same for ebook sites and pages. So slow and too sensitive for taps. This is a one-trick pony and it is Kindle/Amazon. As far as connecting to the internet? No problems. It is just a very slow device. The iPad screams in speed while this slug is barely able to move. I would never trust this for writing (unless I was reading my own writing). It would never keep up with my typing and I don't think my favorite writing apps are even able to run on it.My other real-world problem is there's not a great case for this yet. I'm big into tech protecc. I throw an Otterbox on everything. Once I have everything set up on a device, I don't want to break it and start again. This Max is huge and the glass screen is not going to survive a tumble on my bathroom tile or down the stairs. The one screen saver glass available is too small and did not stay on without massive bubbles. The first silicone case I bought was rubbery junk. The next one I tried was ready and fitted for a keyboard, but I don't want to carry around a keyboard I will rarely use when I have a better Bluetooth one if I need it. The keyboard cases I tried either didn't close well or made this too heavy or too thick to stick into my reader spaces as I read around the house (there are at least two in every room lol). The case I'm using now has a handstrap which is uncomfortable for long hours. The huge honking iPad in an Otterbox case even fits my hand better but battery life? Forget it. The iPad has to be charged off and on all day. This does not only not have to be charged but recharges very fast.Kiddo and I read the same book series yesterday and within an hour she had to plug her mini in. She switched to my new iPad while hers charged and soon that had to be charged too. The Kindle Max was at 83%! So I guess I'm keeping it. I do really enjoy reading on it. So does my kiddo apparently because she keeps borrowing it for manga! She's very nervous about dropping it though so she only reads on it in her bed. I hope there is eventually a good screen protector and case. I have a ton of cases that I tried but all are just terrible that I'm going to now return.SO all in all it's like a C+ to a B- grade. I don't think after all I will gift one to my Mom who is also a big reader because she reads mostly her library ebooks. I think the setup for her outside of directly connecting to her Amazon account will be too much. There are way too many limits between the software and hardware. And she has worse hand arthritis than I do, so I think it will be too uncomfortable for her to hold. She mostly reads on an old iPad. Maybe I'll buy her a new case for that. I would in no way give this to a young kiddo without a very good case. It's bulky and breakable at best.I am also not sure if I would bring this traveling unless there was a good case. Guess I will keep traveling on longer trips with my Kindle Fire 10 since the case is great, it's smaller, and I love that it charges magnetically.It is what it is.",[],
"Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet productivity bundle with Keyboard Case, Stylus Pen, octa-core processor, 4 GB RAM to do more throughout your day, 128 GB, Gray, without lockscreen ads","It's good enough at everything, for people who want one device to do anything.",5.0 out of 5 stars,DoomOfSarnath,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023","Well, for $190-$230 this tablet might not be the best at one particular thing, but thanks to some common-sense decisions and Amazon's resources and commitment, it's competent enough at everything, all at once.Media consumption, retro games, word processing, digital art, battery life, you name it.For media consumers, it has an obscenely long battery life and a pretty nice screen. Contrast is surprisingly good for an IPS display (the black areas look black), colors are very poppy, and the 5:3 aspect ratio means you're not losing much space on either 16:9 or 4:3 content.For retro games, let's talk about the processor. It has a Mali G57 MC2, 2 Cortex A78 cores, and 6 Cortex A55 cores. Anyone who keeps up with Android hardware will know this is a bizarre setup. The Mali G57 MC2 and Cortex A55s are all modest, cheap, power-sipping technology. While the Cortex A78s are freakishly fast for this price point.But I'm certain Amazon did this on purpose, and it's responsible for the great battery life, which is essential for what is basically a media consumption tablet. The modest GPU and high number of ""little"" cores keep battery drain minimal (this is a 5w chip, in a tablet, where 7-10w chips are the norm) while 2 A78s give it some serious oomph for the right sorts of tasks.This accidentally makes this little tablet a retro gaming powerhouse, as that relies heavily on single-core performance, with the GPU and secondary cores being an afterthought.So, it's a tablet that just excels at anything where you'll be using the screen a lot. Reading, movies, old games, etc. It may struggle with native Android games due to the weaker GPU, but compared to retro games there aren't a lot of worthwhile Android games anyway IMO.The keyboard and stylus are also very well executed.I'm typing this review on the keyboard case, and the keys are a nice size thanks to the TKL form factor, with short travel and a nice tactile, springy feel. The trackpad is small, but accurate and doesn't ""lose"" my finger.The stylus itself uses a user-replaceable AAAA battery. I like this decision, because small Li-po batteries wear out fast, and the AAAA means that the stylus has a super long life without worrying about whether you'll be able to find a replacement in a few years. The stylus is also magnetic and clips to the side of the tablet.The stylus is pretty accurate. I don't notice much parallax or judder. My Galaxy Tab S8 actually had slightly more parallax. However, there is more input lag than you'll get with something like a Galaxy Tab S8 or iPad with Apple Pencil. It's a quite noticeable amount of input lag compared to those two. I will mention, this tablet is about 1/3 the price of those devices and actually has a longer battery life. So it's still better than you expect for the price. But will definitely be more of an ""entry level"" art tablet instead of something outstanding.All in all, I still think you're getting a lot more for your money with this tablet than the others available. Amazon's reach with e-readers, with keyboards, with stylus peripherals, with tablets, and their resources and supply chain (ie, being able to order unusual tablet SoCs) has definitely given the Kindle Fire 11 a wider spread of abilities and better quality than your ordinary budget tablet. I can't really name anything I'd expect to be better for the price.The only real flaw is software; since Google Play is not preloaded and Amazon is not putting a lot of effort into their own App store, be prepared to sideload some apps if you want to use the broader spectrum of abilities this tablet has.",[],

I have been updating  to newer tablets as needed for many years. The Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet is the clear winner of them all.  The quality of this Tablet is exceptional from the stainless steel body to the ultra clear screen.  This Tablet is perfect.One thing I love about Amazon Tablet is that if you own and are using a Amazon Tablet now.  Everything is so easy to re-install on the Fire Max 11 tablet.  It immeadiately installs all your Apps, Kindle, Audible without any inputs from the user.  You end up downloading from your libraries what you want installed on the new tablet. Or you can use quickly by going online.I liked the 10 inch and was hesitant to buy the bigger 11 inch tablet, however the size is not any harder to handle and the performance, screen, and operating system is much better.

Indeed the 10 is significantly lighter even thought the size difference between the two is fairly small (same width but 11 is taller when in portrait, so it is wider screen in landscape). It is nice to have both. I will keep using the 11 with the keyboard it came bundled with and I will not get a keyboard for the 10. The keyboard is awesome and having the 11 be wider than the 10 allows the keyboard to be very comfortable. So if you touch-type, and want the attached keyboard, I recommend the 11 over the 10. I've used the keyboard extensively and it really is great (other than accidentally touching the touch pad occasionally, and unintentionally change my typing location).Also, I noticed that the 10 is annoyingly slower than the 11 when rendering all the icons on my home screen. Occasionally the icons disappear and you have to wait for them to reappear. It is only a couple of seconds but I don't recall ever seeing that on a ""regular android"" device, so it is a Fire OS issue that is more apparent with the slower 10. But the main reason I decided to write an update is the SD card issue that some other reviewers mentioned.I thought others had issues because they set up the card as ""internal"" which is essentially (but not quite) like having a bigger internal space for everything including apps. This is dangerous and there is a reason why you can no longer do this with newer versions of Android. So unless you have a zillion apps and really need bigger internal space because of your apps, you really should set up the card as Portable Memory instead (no apps on the card, only media and other files, etc.). Then you can decide what types of files to put there AND you can safely remove the card and access it on another device like your laptop (that's why it is called ""portable""). You can choose to have the Kindle app, Prime Movies, etc download to the card. Most people need expanded memory for media, so this makes sense, and again it is safer. You also have good control over what gets stored on an SD card vs internal storage.But, setting up the card as Internal isn't the reason people had issues, because today for the first time I had the issue that others complained about, which is that my card supposedly unmounted and the Fire asked me to re-format. (This would be a bigger problem if I had set it up as ""Internal"" rather than ""Portable""!!). I shut down the Fire, removed the card, and mounted it in Windows. Windows told me there was a problem with the card and I should scan and fix it. I did. Windows showed it as then fine, no further issues. And I had no trouble copying out all the folders from the card to Windows. Returning the card to the Fire still showed the screen for formatting the card, but I'm wondering if this is because the Fire tends to show screens that were on when you shut down. Or else the card was somehow marked as needing a format. The super weird thing, is, when I said to format as Portable Memory, it did so without removing anything. Doesn't formatting a card mean erasing it (or showing it as blank) so you start over with it fresh ?!?!?  I was going to format it however Fire likes to format, and then return the original folders. But I did not need to copy back anything. It is working fine now. So apparently it would have re-formatted only if I had decided to swap from using it as ""portable"" to ""internal."" Probably every time you unmount (""eject"") the card, you will get this message, and it won't really erase everything and reformat, unless you opt to change how you want to use the card. So all is okay with the card, but this situation should not have happened. It probably happened because some function was writing to the card and another function (an update??) dismounted it, thus interrupting the write. This is why Windows had to fix it.So, I think the card issue almost certainly has nothing to do with the particular card, so others' comments are correct about that. (I've been using a new high-quality Samsung Pro Plus card, overkill for a Fire tablet but it was on sale). When the card issue surfaced, I was trying to do some updates from the Appstore and it seemed frozen. (There is still a problem with the Appstore!). So the Fire was not in a good state. It may be a good idea to reboot it occasionally once in a while (I probably hadn't rebooted for about a month). I was also thinking maybe it was trying to update and that broke its normal functionality. Could be. My biggest suspicion. It is on Fire OS 8.3.2.4, from July 3, 2024. I checked for updates even though it showed as last checking today, and it said to tap to install an update, but when I did, everything froze.  I eventually went back to the updater, and now it said I have 1 update (rather than a bunch of gibberish that suggested some pieces were still downloading, and with a broken button for installing, as initially happened). Now I was able to install the update, and when I re-checked for updates, it showed ""no updates found,"" and the Check Now button reappeared as normal. So all seems fine. Other than the fact that my OS still shows as 8.3.2.4. And it still shows it as being from July 3  (today is Aug 7). And I did not get the usual message that my system has updated. It was a secret undocumented thing, or the old update re-installed (why??). Perhaps it was not a Fire OS update but an update of some other built-in component (like the Apstore, or some such thing). The Appstore still seems hung on the page where I update apps. The other parts of it work. It is an issue with the app, because F-Droid can install and update just fine. And my new Fire 10 also works fine, so it is not the server for the Appstore. I'm now thinking it got a corrupted (interrupted?) update and won't work until Amazon has a newer update that I can install on top of it.Amazon, if you are listening: please please be normal about updates. Let your users know there is an update and let them pick when to do the update. If control-freak Apple can do this, you can, too. I do not want to be using my device while it is trying to update (or shutting it down to remove a corrupted card...). That's just asking for trouble. I want to have it plugged in and keep my hands off it for a while. This is a problem with other Amazon devices as well. Okay, you're gonna force an update whether I like it or not, but please, if you don't want to cause a lot of grief, just let people have some control (and awareness!!!!!) when the device needs to be updated. My guess is that even when there is only a minor update (as seems to have been the case for me), the Kindle is not fully functional but pretends to be, and since it is not fully functional (it quits some processes), some unexpected quits will cause corruptions/crashes/SD card issues.....But otherwise it is a good device. Truly. I'm still happy to have it. I love the whale background :-)Initial Review:I got the productivity bundle and I am super pleased. I needed something to take notes with in classes, that also had a touch screen for drawing, and this is great for that. (Amazon Appstore has OneNote and Squid and both are great for notes with this.) In my experience it DOES matter which app you use with the pen because a paint app I tried worked but was slow (so I blame the app, since OneNote and Squid are fine). There is also a fairly new open source app called Saber that seems great (I still need to experiment with that one -- available on F-Droid). I'm thinking that some of the professional reviews (on other web sites) got an early or different version of the pen because the harsh criticisms of it do not match my experience. It works great.This is my 2nd Fire tablet, and I like it so much better than my first one, Fire 8 HD from 2017. I wasn't unhappy with the old tablet when I got it (because I got it on sale for a great price) but I just almost never used it because the screen was so unpleasant and stressful to look at, plus the device was annoyingly slow. Not so with this new tablet -- I am very pleased with the screen quality, and the speed is good for how I'm using it.The pen and keyboard are truly awesome. I wasn't sure at first whether I liked the aspect ratio/shape of the tablet but actually it makes sense. The longer shape allows for nearly full-sized key spacing on the keyboard while not causing the tablet to be unnecessarily large and heavy, as it would be with the iPad's aspect ratio. Someone said they prefer the snap-in clamshell keyboard that is available for the 10, but I much prefer this thin-and-light keyboard (didn't have the 10 but considered it and looked at pics of its keyboard). It is super easy and fast to pull off and snap on the keyboard and it does not need batteries. At home (where I have ""real"" laptops) I use the tablet mostly without the keyboard, and half of the keyboard case stays on it, protecting the back and the camera, and giving the tablet a nice non-slip feel, plus I can use the fold-out stand. I don't use it on my lap at school, and at home I use a lap desk so I don't mind that I can't put it directly in my lap while typing. Really, I have no complaints at all about this setup. Perfect.Well, maybe I can complain a little about Fire OS but it is mostly okay. I would hate it for a phone but it is fine for a tablet. And it is much improved over what I had on my old Fire, especially the settings (I like to have control and info). I put Google Play on my previous Fire but I'm not sure I will do so on this one. I mean I have an Android phone that has things I'd like from the Play store, like my calculator collection and bank apps and whatnot. I don't need to replicate that on this tablet. I've installed F-Droid so I can still easily put a bunch of nice apps on it. I have a Linux terminal app (Termux) and will probably install a small Linux distro with desktop which will further expand the usability. Plus I have a Microsoft 360 subscription from work and it is nice to have an app for that on this tablet too. It has the most critical work apps like Zoom and Teams and Office and Outlook. So it already has what I really need on a tablet. Oh, and Kindle, of course. I think in the past it was almost necessary to side-load Google Play but the Amazon Appstore now has my most critical apps, at least for a tablet. (Yea, it generally is not great and not well maintained, with tons of outdated apps.) Don't be mad at Amazon about Google Play Store, YouTube, etc. It is a Google policy. Google does not want others to take the open source piece of Android and build their own thing on top of it, with no control from Google. There are penalties for doing that. And Amazon couldn't sell its media to you directly on regular Android, so it kind of has to make a separate OS. This is your tradeoff for getting a subsidized tablet. I'm poor so I will accept the tradeoff, especially for a tablet as nice as this one.I paid to get rid of the ads, and I do that on every Kindle or Fire (I value discounts a lot, but aesthetics even more) and now this tablet is a pleasure to use. And soooo much less expensive than a similar setup would have been from Apple.",[],
"Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet productivity bundle with Keyboard Case, Stylus Pen, octa-core processor, 4 GB RAM to do more throughout your day, 128 GB, Gray, without lockscreen ads",WORST COMPUTING DEVICE I HAVE EVER OWNED.  DO NOT BUY.,1.0 out of 5 stars,JustAFilmGuy,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2024","BACKGROUND:  I have worked in Information Systems for decades (as a help desk analyst, business analyst, technical analyst, developer, project manager, etc.).  I have owned varieties of desktops, laptops, peripherals, smart phones, iPhones, etc.  This Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet is absolutely the worst computing device I have ever owned.  It's too late to return it, so I'm considering selling it for $50 just to get it out of the house.-------------------------------------------------------THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS ARE DOCUMENTED BY OTHER FIRE MAX USERS (...just Google it):A. Applications simply shut down, for no reason, without notice, after five to ten minutes of use (e.g., MS Word, YouTube, etc.).B. Doesn't remember  settings from one startup to the next.C.  In many soft or hard device re-starts, the Fire Max 11 tells me the Sandisk SD Card I added for extra storage is not recognized and has to be re-inserted.  A reboot causes this ""tablet"" to forget the problem.  The issue is not that I have to re-insert the Sandisk SD card.  The issue is that the Fire Max inconsistently does or does not recognize the Sandisk SD card.  Sandisk SD cards are high-quality storage devices.  I do not have this problem with Sandisk SD cards that I use in my Fujifilm cameras, audio devices, or other laptops.D. File Management utility has very poor functionality.  Intuitive right-click functionality is not available to move files around, copy/paste files.  Cannot rename files.E. Downloaded/installed Amazon's ""Notepad"" utility, which is a joke.F.  ""Silk"" Browser lacks important and useful functionality that can be found on ALL browser utilities for over twenty years (e.g., bookmark management, font size, available settings or setting retention, color choices, etc.)G.  Silk Browser offers ZERO options to adjust font size or Zoom the objects in the screen...features that ARE available in other browsers.  The ONLY option provided by Silk is the ""Pinch-Zoom"" which truncates all content on the right or left of the window in use.  Compare this with any browser on a laptop computer, where the +/- Zoom enables objects to be zoomed...but the content still remains INSIDE the physical screen of the laptop.H.  No good browsers are available to install on this Fire Max 11 tablet (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)  You are stuck with Silk as your only browser option.I.  Installed MS Word software functionality is incomplete, when compared with modern word processing tools.  But you cannot use the ""Wordperfect"" option that the Fire Max 11 repeatedly offers, because of errors on attempting the install.J.  Just saving a Word document of simple text is a struggle.  The ability to CTRL/A highlight the text in the file, to then set all the text to the same font type and size....is NOT A FUNCTION THAT IS AVAILABLE.K. Almost ZERO third-party software utilities exist to download and install on this ""tablet"".  Compare this with other brands of tablets where good third-party software is available.L.  Weird error messages pop-up in almost every session, about some already installed utility being too new or too old for the version of Android on the device.  What is causing all these weird, random, out of context error messages?M. In conclusion, I wasted $200 on this Amazon Fire Max 11 piece of junk. I will sell it for $50, just so I can stop looking at it.  Do not make my mistake.  Go check out Google or Microsoft or Apple tablets.  I love Amazon, but Amazon needs to leave tablet manufacturing to companies that have a history of tablet manufacturing.-------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:  AFTER ANOTHER MONTH OF USEA. Application shutdowns have become more frequent (e.g., YouTube just shutting off).B.  Application lock-ups have now started.  Previously, YouTube app would just shut off.  Now, it locks up while a video is playing.  No mouse clicks or keyboard clicks can get the screen to respond.  Only solution is the to do a ""hard reboot"" by press/hold the physical power button.C.  After YouTube lockup and ""hard reboot"", YouTube then FAILS to restart.  Clicking the YouTube icon activates YouTube as usual, and begins the ""increasing percentage"" display that occurs with each start up.  However, when activating YouTube after a ""hard reboot"", the ""percentage"" display never goes beyond 10%.  Instead, I am required to do a soft reboot or hard reboot of the device to get YouTube to start working again.CONCLUSION:  I consider this device to be pretty much unusable.  I purchased this device to check news during the workday, so that I would not use my employer laptop for personal stuff.SELL THE FIRE MAX?  I previously thought of selling this device.  But I now feel it would be unethical of me to sell a device to someone, knowing that the device is defective.  I will keep the device in hopes that I can use it as just a poorly functioning Kindle book reader.",[],
"Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet productivity bundle with Keyboard Case, Stylus Pen, octa-core processor, 4 GB RAM to do more throughout your day, 128 GB, Gray, without lockscreen ads","It's good, but Amazon is holding back it's full potential.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nightweeb92,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2024","First off I have two of these, one I set up for my sister and another I have for personal media consumption.I'll start with the cons: no fast charge and I believe this only supports up to 15w charging at max. Lowering the charge time down to about 3.5hrs instead of 4.2, and it ships with a 9w power brick so I recommend using something other than the included brick if you want to knock 30 minutes off charge times.They have a screen protector but they don't provide something like and anti-blue light tempered glass screen protector. The screen is low blue light which is a good thing, but I'm sure consumers would want to generally have the option to additionally add an anti-blue light screen protector anyway ..even better if it's tempered glass for the added protection while retaining visual clarity.There's not too many great cases and the first party one is really pricey. I wish they had also made their own tri-fold smart folio style case as one I got felt like it was designed well but the quality wasn't good. (If they do make a tri-fold case eventually, I hope they make it in more than just three colors and with a tpu backing) or sell the kickstand backing separately from the keyboard.Limited first party apps due to lack of the full android implementation, this also limits the whole productivity portion they're trying to sell to consumers, it does do a handful but don't go expecting this to compare to an ipad or Microsoft surface tablet ..or even a fully Integrated android tablet.For the processor this is pushing, it would've been nice to see this have at least 8gb of RAM, but generally this is competing with the likes of my old Google Pixel 3 XL rather than any full fledged tablets out there. Even then it's only slightly better.And last Amazon either needs to ditch FireOS or update it to a current version of Android, this is still an android tablet running an Amazon skin over it that's about 3 generations behind running android 11. Either Amazon should update it or make a hybrid Operating system that can do both desktop android and tablet, this way programs can be installed to utilize the productivity side of this machine.pros: great screen that runs 2k resolution, colors are nice and vivid with a natural color tone and decent blacks The pixel density at this size means the images are nice and sharp too being squeezed in a smaller form factor. it's not the highest rated HDR but it's far from the worst.The touch screen is pretty responsive with no lag, unless you're playing an extremely graphic heavy game the unit can't handle and you hit deep frame dips where it becomes slow.Speakers aren't too bad, they retain fullness at louder volumes and it does get a decent amount of volume, don't expect it to be loud enough to fill a room though, but the sound chip does it's job well and the Dolby surround is pretty good imo, sounds better through headphones either wireless or wired with a USB-C adapter.Expandable storage! such an ancient yet god tier part of the specs that every piece of tech these days has unfortunately phased out. This tablet supports up to 1TB with a microSD memory card, I hope any future versions keep this feature. I also hope other companies would also go back to using this method of expandable storage.Now as for things I'd like to see in the future if they either plan on updating this version or make future versions.If a revision was made, I'd like to see fast charging, at least 8Gb of RAM with a snapdragon 8 gen 3 mobile chip. I'd also like to see Amazon ditch FireOS and just use the proprietary Android OS or use a hybrid desktop/tablet format, they can just fill it with their bloatware. FireOS just looks really outdated and takes me back to when I had my old 2nd gen fire HD 7"" (not a good look). Maybe it'd be nice if the keyboard had backlit keys. For the love of God add google play store (that alone would make any fire tablet sell like crazy, Amazon is really hurting themselves here and it's embarrassing, listen to the userbase and the money will flow).As for accessories, it'd be nice if Amazon made a tempered glass anti-blue light screen protector, the screen already has low blue light, but it'd be nice to also have that option on top of it.As for covers, why doesn't Amazon make a magnetic cover that rotates from portrait/landscape mode? make a trifold rotation case or a smart folio (preferably with a tpu backing)As for the current version, either do an OS overhaul through a firmware update, Get us past android 11 ..or just completely update the system to fully run android. You have no idea how much people would love to have a customizable home screen and widget with the android experience plus Google would regularly cover security updates for the device.Overall: This is a decent tablet, it's not slow but I wouldn't say it's immediately snappy either in some areas, it's best use case is media consumption and some light mobile gaming. The L1 wifi encoding is great for consistent video playback and I almost never get stream buffering which is nice. The app store is abysmal and the OS is outdated and lacking, I hope people who get this are tech savvy enough to find a way to get the full potential out of this. I opted out of an ipad mini 6, although it is more powerful it doesn't have upgradable storage and is about $250 more expensive, hopefully I don't end up with buyers remorse. I went with a 64GB ad free version and added a 512GB microSD (seems overkill but I play some pretty big mobile games that sometimes hit above 25GB with internal updates in total)Edit: my additional complain is read/write speeds with the microSD card. Naturally, native storage will run faster, so those that got the 128gb don't really have this problem until they run out of storage and have to pop in a card, but even with a A2 Level read/write speed apps saved to the microSD feel a little sluggish at times to open. Hopefully one day there's an update to properly support faster read/write speeds for microSD.For those that got the 64gb version like I did. Save your most used apps on the native storage and your less important ones to a microSD, that way your more used apps will load in faster.Thank you for your review.I'd also like to add that this tablet is pretty hefty, it's not really a pro or a con. The heft adds to a premium feel, holding it while reading will cause some fatigue after about 6 minutes. It's about as heavy as an 11 inch lenovo yoga laptop I own ..and that has a keyboard on it.",[],
"Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet productivity bundle with Keyboard Case, Stylus Pen, octa-core processor, 4 GB RAM to do more throughout your day, 128 GB, Gray, without lockscreen ads","Best tablet since the HDX, but....  [Nov. 27, 2023 - final update]",3.0 out of 5 stars,dd,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2023","Bought my first Android tablet (a Galaxy Tab S9) today. Why?  If you want a tablet simply to watch videos, shop on Amazon, read Kindle books, play a few games and use a few apps, there's probably no better deal than the Max, and the S9 is both way more expensive and complicated to set up than the Fire (unless you've got a Samsung smartphone.) But I am tired of needing to boot the Max 2 or 3 times in a row before it truly works. I'm tired of the Max hanging and kicking me out of apps. Now, I have a lot of apps and do a lot of multitasking so I've probably simply outgrown Amazon. I  hope this helps with your decision-making.9/25/2023:TL;DR - By the start of this month, I had had it with this tablet. When it worked, it was fine. But it froze constantly, kicked me out of apps, took up to 2 minutes to reboot, sometimes required two reboots in succession to work properly. But on Sept. 16, the OS was updated to version 8.3.2.0. In the past two weeks, most of the problems have disappeared. There are still occasional glitches, but recovery is quick.I'm hoping this won't change, but will update this review if it does.N.B. This is my 8th Fire Tablet, starting with the original. My current tablet is the HD10 (2021)N.B. The restore problem has more or less (maybe less) been fixed (see below), so I've upgraded my review to 3 stars.July 3, 2023 Update to Performance section.What kind of buyers should look at this tablet?Apple users? You're kidding, right? Of course not.Android users who want a  less expensive tablet? Not unless they're willing to accept a stripped down, less functional interface. Skins for Android are usually designed to enhance the experience. Amazon, on the other hand, removes functionality and is based on Android11which is, per The Verge, nearly 3 generations out of  date. I don't know if this is by design, contracts with Google or what. But Amazon clearly has no interest in competing in the wider Android market and doesn't mind shortchanging its own customers.The Amazon ecosystem? Yes. If, like me, you have hitched your pony to Amazon Prime and Kindle, yes, then take a look because it does appear to be the best Fire tablet yet. I ordered it because my 2021 HD10 has slowed to the point where molasses moves faster. I am hoping I can get this Fire to work without spending hours and hours and hours to reconstruct my environment. N.B. As an original Fire owner, I own a lot of apps and games I would have to buy if I bought a non-Amazon tablet.If you already own a Fire tablet, most of the things I dislike about the Fire tablets in general do not appear to have not changed.Unboxing: Hands down this is the easiest unboxing of any Amazon device ever. You simply pull off a strip with arrows on it and pull out the Max11. The tablet boots up in landscape mode (which some professional reviewers have asserted is how the tablet is designed to be used) but then quickly reverts to portrait mode. N.B. I had to hold the power button (upper left) down for 3-5 seconds.Display: Amazon's ""latest & greatest"" has a screen resolution of  2000 X 1200. The 2013(!) HDX 8.9 had a screen resolution of 2460 x 1600. What was Amazon thinking? (It's not that the resolution isn't good, it is, but it could be better.)Form Factor: For me, the 8.9 inch HDX was the perfect size. Large enough to comfortably read a book or watch a video, small enough to fit in a courier bag. The 10-inch HD, which I've had for two years, is very uncomfortable to hold and will not fit into a courier pouch.  This tablet is, however, lightweight (without the cover and keyboard) and feels quite speedy. I've written a review about the bundle elsewhere.Folders: You still cannot create a folder on the Home screen, then click to see a list of apps and add them in. Every inexpensive Android smartphone has had this functionality for years. I assume every one of Amazon's programmers has such a phone. Why Amazon can't add this simple feature is beyond me. Also, you still cannot sort the apps in a folder.Keyboard: You  apparently cannot use the on-display keyboard if the physical keyboard is attached. I think I understand the logic, and  it is easy to attach/detach the keyboard  with Amazon's bundle, but I wonder how it will work with other physical keyboards.The recharger: It ships with a 9W charger. Why oh why oh why. You'll need to buy the 15W recharger yourself. Don't bother unless recharge time is very important to you.Performance: This tablet is quite zippy. I was able to move between Silk, email, Kindle and Twitter quickly and easily. I didn't do any benchmarks, but performance seemed almost as good as my Galaxy S20+ or my XPS8700.  Except, well, sometimes it slows down to molasses - because, apparently, it can't handle background downloads.ALERT: If  the MAX starts to slow down or freeze a lot, check for downloads (app/game update, email, even notifications). Most Android devices can handle a 20 or 30 MB background download with no effect on performance. Not so the Max. Set your updates to Manual, and then update each app/game independently. {See top of review, TL;DR, for update on performance.)RESTORE PROBLEM:As I posted with my 2 star review, the restore from my HD10-2021 failed completely. None of my apps, folders, bookmarks or Silk history were restored.Unable to reach a person at Amazon, I finally simply restored the Max to factory defaults and set it up again. This time the restore did work, sort of.  It took almost 5 hours to get most everything. I got my Silk bookmarks back but not my Silk history. There are still a bunch of anomalies I am working through. If you're interested, I'll post all the gory details in Amazon's Digital and Device Forum (https://www.amazonforum.com/s/topic/0TO6Q000000QQOxWAO/fire-max-11) in the next day or two.Old Stuff: The Google Play StoreI can't confirm this is still true with the Max, but:1. No. Amazon still does not support the Google Play Store. I don't know why. I assume it makes too much money from its own inadequate play store?2. You can download and  install APKs from trusted sites and they will run, provided you allow the installation of external apps  (Apps  & Notifications/Special App access/Enable for Silk.) They will work provided they don't need access to Google Play Services.3. It has been possible to install the Google Play Store on most of the previous generations of the Fire, and I assume it can still be done. It involves downloading four apps in a particular sequence. The hows are available on the net.  It is possible that this may create a problem in the future, but, so far, most of those who go to the trouble of doing it don't regret it. So, if you are a techie and desperately want something that will only work with Google Play Services, it's worth a try. You can always uninstall the components later.",[],

I’m not really a tech person so can’t go into full details regarding that type of stuff, however it works really well for the purpose it was bought for. Love the feel of it. Feels like a premium device. I choose the model without the ads.

This device was easy to set up and use, love that there was an option to choose no advertisement. Wished it came in other colors like the Fire Max 10 and others. What will make this Tablet a 10 out of 10 for me is the ability to customize the home screen like Android devices not a big fan of the Amazon operating system and their standard home screen set up. Came with a 9.0 charging block and I must say it charges very fast. Size wise it’s a 11” tablet but it’s slim wish the screen was a bit more broaden like the 10. I’ve had no issues reading books on this device on Wattpad and I love watching movies on it. I have a personal business Amazon account and business account and have no issues switching back and forth between the 2 on my other devices and phone, however on this device using the Amazon shop app it came with I am unable to do so.
